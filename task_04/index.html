            <h2>ChatGPT</h2>
            <p>ChatGPT is a generative artificial intelligence chatbot developed by OpenAI and released on
                November 30,
                2022. It uses large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o along with other multimodal models to generate
                human-like responses in text, speech, and images.[3][4] It has access to features such as searching the
                web,
                using apps, and running programs.[5][6] It is credited with accelerating the AI boom, an ongoing period
                of
                rapid investment in and public attention to the field of artificial intelligence (AI).[7] Some observers
                have raised concern about the potential of ChatGPT and similar programs to displace human intelligence,
                enable plagiarism, or fuel misinformation.[8][9]</p>
