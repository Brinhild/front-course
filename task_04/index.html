            <h2>ChatGPT</h2>
            <p>ChatGPT is a generative artificial intelligence chatbot developed by OpenAI and released on
                November 30,
                2022. It uses large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o along with other multimodal models to generate
                human-like responses in text, speech, and images.[3][4] It has access to features such as searching the
                web,
                using apps, and running programs.[5][6] It is credited with accelerating the AI boom, an ongoing period
                of
                rapid investment in and public attention to the field of artificial intelligence (AI).[7] Some observers
                have raised concern about the potential of ChatGPT and similar programs to displace human intelligence,
                enable plagiarism, or fuel misinformation.[8][9]</p>

            <h2>DeepSeek</h2>
            <p>Hangzhou DeepSeek Artificial Intelligence Basic Technology Research Co., Ltd.,[3][4][5][a] doing business
                as
                DeepSeek,[b] is a Chinese artificial intelligence company that develops large language models (LLMs).
                Based
                in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Deepseek is owned and funded by the Chinese hedge fund High-Flyer. DeepSeek was
                founded in July 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, the co-founder of High-Flyer, who also serves as the CEO for both

            <h2>Google Cloud Platform</h2>
            <p>Cloud AI refers to artificial intelligence services and tools that are hosted and delivered via cloud computing platforms.
                These solutions enable businesses and developers to access powerful AI capabilities without needing to build their own infrastructure.
                Cloud AI is typically provided by major tech companies like Google (Google Cloud AI), Microsoft (Azure AI), Amazon (AWS AI), and IBM (IBM Watson).
                The services offered can include machine learning platforms, natural language processing, computer vision, and AI-powered analytics.
                These tools help companies automate processes, gain insights from data, and create intelligent applications.
                Cloud AI democratizes access to advanced AI by reducing costs and technical barriers.
                Companies can easily integrate AI into their products using APIs and pre-trained models.
                This is especially useful for small and medium businesses that lack in-house expertise.
                The technology is evolving rapidly, with continuous improvements in model accuracy, scalability, and real-time processing.
                Future prospects of Cloud AI include more personalized services, automation in various industries, and the development of smarter digital assistants.
                Additionally, Cloud AI plays a crucial role in fields like healthcare, finance, manufacturing, and retail by optimizing operations and enabling data-driven decisions.
                As AI models grow more complex, cloud platforms ensure they remain accessible and manageable for users worldwide.</p>
